# Fixus
Predictive maintenance for on-site telecommunication equipments

## Introduction
Fixus is a winning submission for the UM Hackathon 2022 in the Telecommunication domain. It is a predictive maintenance dashboard web application designed to help predict telecommunication equipment failures.

This repository is the web application dashboard only. The machine learning model was done in AWS Sagemaker (not included in this repo)

## Modules
The application is composed of the following modules:

### Equipment Monitoring
This module allows users to monitor the health status and performance of telecommunication equipment in real-time using a dashboard interface. Users can visualize the data collected from sensors and other sources and identify potential issues that may affect the equipment's performance.

### Equipment Statistics
This module provides users with detailed analysis of equipment, including average utilization, downtime frequency, and error rates. The analysis is based on real-time data collected from the equipment, which is processed and analyzed using statistical algorithms. The module provides a user-friendly dashboard with visualizations and reports that display the equipment's statistics.

### Maintenance Schedule
This module facilitates scheduling preventive maintenance tasks based on the predictions generated by the predictive models. The module provides recommendations for the timing and scope of maintenance tasks based on the predicted failure rates and other factors. Users can schedule preventive maintenance tasks via the dashboard, and the system will send alerts and notifications when maintenance is due.

## Tech Used
The application was developed using the following technologies:

Flask: a micro web framework used to build the application's backend.
AWS Sagemaker: a machine learning service used to build and train the predictive models used to predict equipment failures.
AWS Lambda: a serverless compute service used to run the predictive models in the cloud.
AWS API Gateway: a fully managed service that makes it easy to create, publish, and maintain APIs at scale. The API Gateway was used to expose the application's backend as a RESTful API.
